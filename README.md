## End Notes

It was an indivisual project that I have built in 5 days after learning react. Implemented frontend. I have used Chakra UI for UI design. I tried to do as much functionality as I could do in just 5 days. Need to fix/ modify the site in some areas. Thank you for visiting my github ü§ç.
